# PARAPHRASING WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

# SUMMARY
Paraphrasing, the art of expressing the same ideas using different words, has emerged as a fundamental component of natural language understanding and generation. In an era defined by the digital deluge of information, effective paraphrasing plays a pivotal role in facilitating communication, preserving academic integrity, and enhancing content creation. At the forefront of this transformative landscape lies the Pegasus model, a groundbreaking achievement built upon the foundation of the Transformer architecture. Pre-trained on a wealth of textual data, Pegasus exhibits a profound understanding of language structure and semantics, making it exceptionally adept at text-to-text tasks, including paraphrasing and summarization. Prompt engineering is a strategic approach that refines and customizes the way Pegasus generates paraphrased content, thereby optimizing its performance for specific contexts, tasks, or requirements. By carefully crafting prompts, users can steer Pegasus toward generating paraphrased text that aligns more closely with their intended goals. This abstract explores the dynamic synergy between paraphrasing and the Pegasus model, highlighting the model's ability to revolutionize content generation, streamline information dissemination, and address the evolving demands of our text-driven world. With Pegasus as a catalyst, the potential for innovative applications in diverse domains and languages is virtually boundless, promising a future where language is not just understood but also transformed with unprecedented precision and versatility. As a result, even though we have a model with better scores, we still have problems with prompt engineering.
